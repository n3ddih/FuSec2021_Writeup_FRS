## Brief

In the tcp stream, there is a notable *png header* datas (*PNG*, *IHDR*,...). We can manually extract the file raw data, or we can just use a file carving tool such as *foremost* to carve the file out.

## Details

### Get file manually

Open the pcap file in *Wireshark* and follow the TCP stream. View the stream in raw and copy the data.

Open *HxD*, create a new file and paste the copied data into HxD. Find the PNG header, identify where the image start and end then delete all the rest.

### Get file using file carving tool

The simplest method to solve is using a file carving tool such as `foremost`.

```console
$ foremost dump.pcap
